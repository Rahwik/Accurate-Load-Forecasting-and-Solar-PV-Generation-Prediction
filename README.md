# Energy Load Forecasting and Solar PV Generation Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict energy consumption and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy generation. The predictions are served through an interactive Flask-based web application.

---

## Features
- **Load Forecasting:** Predict energy consumption based on factors such as time and historical usage.
- **Solar PV Generation Prediction:** Estimate energy output from solar panels considering environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance.
